                Born in 1971 in Tbilisi, Levan Mosiashvili is a distinguished Georgian artist whose journey spans 
                from biological sciences to becoming an internationally recognized painter. A self-taught artist 
                with four distinct art periods - Georgian, French, Modern, and Abstract - his work has captured 
                the hearts of collectors across the globe.

              <p className="text-lg text-foreground/70 font-inter leading-relaxed">
                Granted the prestigious talent passport by the French government in 2008, Levan became the first 
                Georgian to receive this honor. His paintings now grace private collections and galleries across 
                multiple continents, and his recent work was recognized as one of the most successful paintings 
                of the year at Art New York 2023.
